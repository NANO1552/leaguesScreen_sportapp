leagues screen for SWIFTERS

########################### R E A D ###########################################

As the team leader of SWIFTERS, I initially created a UI sketch in Figma to guide the team, allowing room for modifications to improve the design. I then assigned small tasks to each team member sequentially. Unfortunately, we encountered challenges due to one member not responding from the beginning. This situation forced us to frequently adjust our plans, and we were unable to complete the app due to a lack of understanding and coordination, despite my best efforts.

In the end, I managed to develop the Leagues screen using Cubit. I hope you find it satisfactory.
